# free-vscode
a simple bash script that prevents vs code form filling up you session with cache.

## ⚠️ Important
This script relies on macOS-specific folder paths `~/Library/Caches` 
So it will **not work on Linux or Windows** without modifications.


## install and forget
Copy and paste this into your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayouz0/free-vscode/main/vscode-goinfre.sh)"
